## Description

This is a Vehicle Builder project that allows the user to create and select vehicles in the terminal. In there, you are able to create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle. After going through the creation process or the selection process, the user is able to perform certain actions. This application is built using TypeScript and Classes. This is for Module 8 of the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

## Installation

To install this project, the user must clone the repository from GitHub (The link where you are reading this). The user must have Typescript installed. Once you are in the repository, run the command "npm install" to install the necessary packages and dependencies. After that, all you need to do is run the command "npm run start" to start the application.

## Usage

Once 'npm run start' is ran, the user will be prompted to create a new vehicle or select an existing vehicle (there are a few vehicles present already). The user can create a vehicle by selecting the type of vehicle (car, truck, or motorbike) and then entering the vehicle information (color, make, age, weight, so on). The user can then use the created vehicle. If the user selects an existing vehicle, they can use the selected vehicle. The user can perform actions with the vehicle and see the result of the action in the command-line. The user can perform additional actions until they choose to exit. The actions the user can perform are including, but not limited to, aceelerating, decelerating, doing a wheelie (for motorbikes), and towing (for trucks). You can also turn left and right or print any necessary information about the vehicle.

The details for the created vehicle are stored only temporarily in the application. Once the application is closed, the details are lost. The user can create a new vehicle with the same details if they wish to do so. There is no database or file storage for the vehicles.
